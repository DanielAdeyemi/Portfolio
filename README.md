***by Daniel Adeyemi***
This project aimed to conclude first 3 weeks of practice at **Epicodus** and create web site by using HTML/CSS with basic information about me, such as
* Background info
* My interests
* What brought me into world of programming

No special setup required, your laptop with internet connection would be just enough.
